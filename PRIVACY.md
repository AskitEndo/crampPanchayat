**CrampPanchayat - Privacy-First Period Tracking**

_Last Updated: July 6, 2025_

## 🌟 Our Privacy Commitment

CrampPanchayat is built with privacy as the foundation. We believe menstrual health data is deeply personal, and we've designed our app to protect your privacy while providing useful tracking features. **This app is production-ready with comprehensive privacy protections and real-time security features.**

## 🎭 Anonymous by Design
